# M04L11 - PRACTICE

## PART I - SETUP

    - Create a new folder named "solutions" within the "tests" folder.
    - Create a new spec file called "M04-solution.spec.ts" inside the "solutions" directory.

## PART II - CREATE NEW TEST USING PLAYWRIGHT RECOMMENDED METHODS

Use this page: https://testpages.eviltester.com/styled/validation/input-validation.html to create tests.

    - Create a new test for the input form using only Playwright-recommended methods.
    - Fill in the input form with valid data.
    - Submit the form and verify that the data you entered are visible on the summary page.

## PART III - ADD TAGS

    - Add new tags to your test: "@M04" and "@solution". Refer to the Playwright documentation to learn how to add multiple tags.
    - Run your test from the terminal using tags.

## PART IV - CLEANUP

    - Copy the solution spec you created for "M03" and paste it into the "solutions" directory.
    - Rename the spec to "M03-solution.spec.ts".
    - Add the tags "@M03" and "@solution" to the tests in "M03-solution.spec.ts".
    - Run your tests from the terminal using the "@solution" tag.
